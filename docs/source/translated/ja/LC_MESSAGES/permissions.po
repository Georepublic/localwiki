msgid "LocalWiki uses a pretty flexible system of permissions that allows the administrator to say who is allowed to add, change, and delete different objects (pages, maps, files, etc.).  It also lets the administrator ban users who are malicious."

# bba5074be0c74603b2be1489a11e7263
msgid "There are two levels of permissions: by type of object (i.e., page, map, etc.) and by specific object (i.e., \"Front Page\").  This allows you to set the default permissions for all objects and still adjust them for certain objects that should be more protected (or more open)."

msgid "Users can belong to one or more Group, and new groups can be added any time. You can grant permissions to each group, and the users in that group will inherit those permissions.  This makes role-based permissions possible, allowing you, for example, to create a group called \"Trusted Users\" and give this group additional permissions."

msgid "It is good practice to grant permissions to groups instead of individual users because it's more manageable (there are lots of users and few groups) and maintainable (users come and go, and it's much easier to add and remove them from groups as needed)."
